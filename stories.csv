"July, 2025",-,HR Manager,"So, this work-from-home approach is something that really gives employees flexibility. So that is one thing, like being paused by the pandemic. I think it's a positive thing that we have now adapted. And the second is digitization, of course. So, before the pandemic, there were many who did not even know how to use a Zoom meeting, a team meeting, or Google Meet. And nowadays, everyone is hands-on."

"June, 2025",India,HR Practitioner,"It is a significant shift. Chat GPT is the topic of hot conversation today. The future will be about changing skill requirements in the market, and if you want to remain relevant, if you want to have your skin in the game, where people are looking for you. You will have to learn new skills every year, practically, henceforth."
"May, 2023",USA,HR Manager,"Whether they're drivers, driving Uber, Lyft, and groceries and things like that, or they're graphic designers working from home for a bunch of different firms. And so you've created various tools to help them. Yeah, some new products, for example, that come around in the insurance space. So direct easy access to dental insurance, to medical insurance, to lifestyle types of products, identity theft, or pet insurance. These types of products are things that we may take for granted, having disability insurance. If we get sick, we have some wage protection as a traditional W2 employee. These are programs that are more and more accessible with the normalization of the gig economy for the workers these days. We're super proud to have been at the forefront of this conversation. And now, you know, I've been doing the technology platform here at DDI for quite a while."
"April, 2022",-,HR Manager,"It's interesting here to note that a 2018 survey conducted by the International Labour Organization found that 88% of gig workers across the world wanted more work, not less. Although they were all aware of the dark side of the platform economy, which leads us to ask, is there a way we can address the challenges of the platform economy without throwing the baby with the bathwater? How can we help, for instance, workers get onto platforms, make a living, and also ensure that they get a good deal and that they are treated fairly? How can we ensure that platforms become attractive to workers? How can we ensure that regulators are able to distinguish between platforms that treat employees badly and platforms that treat them well? And how can we inform end users about how to make informed and ethical choices about the platforms from which to seek their goods and services?"
"January, 2019",-,HR Manager,"As employers want to attract talent in specific areas for specific projects, HR will need to look at how it offers non-permanent staff training, benefits, how it facilitates meaningful communication with these workers and how it makes them feel part of the team. For employers, the gig economy enables access to wider talent, improved agility, reduced payroll costs, and greater potential for innovation. However, there are also downsides, such as security issues and competitive risks."
"March, 2020",Australia,International Business Coach and Business Owner,"What has changed, though, is the growing trend of highly skilled workers leaving the restrictive 9-5 deskbound jobs and choosing to work on their own terms in an environment of their choice. So what's caused this change? I guess the biggest cause of the change has been the evolution of this device we now have, which is a combination of, if you're old enough to remember, a Walkman, a telephone, a letterbox, and a global library all wrapped up in a device called a mobile phone or a laptop. And this is really empowering traditional deskbound employees with the physical freedom that was never possible before. The world is now affordably highly connected to the nanosecond, and with the delivery of 5 G on its way and rolling out of the NBN, it's only going to become faster and more dispersed. The gig economy has been equally embraced by business owners and employees."
